Curry's MVP

I think some people forget that the Bulls' went to the 2nd round of the playoffs two years in a row, while MJ was getting his baseball fix. Curry's numbers also reflect his scoring ability. I would remind everybody that back in Jordan's day, space and pace didn't exist. A team could pack in the paint because the array of skilled players hadn't quite taken hold of the NBA.
